    <!-- Additional information & comments -->
    <p style="padding-top: 10px; margin: auto; width: 50%;">This table lists a lot of the highlights in JavaScript's development over the last 26 years. There are a lot of other JS tools, frameworks, and libraries out there, such as the popular ReactJS. One other thing to point out is that the modern JS developer no longer needs to worry about whether a site supports a current ECMA version of JS, but whether or not an individual feature they want to use has reached stage 4 in the standardization process, as of 2016. Current progress on proposed features can be reviewed on <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>
